	<p>Throughout my childhood, I have seen many different creations of shows, movies, and games that greatly impacted me. When I was younger, seeing all these creations of my favorite games and shows made me want to grow up and make my own things that I can be proud of. When I was 9 years old I wanted to create robots that were like stuffed animals but able to move like a real person and talk to people like how a real person could. I gave up that idea and wanted to create 3D animated videos instead when I turned 13 years old so that I could have a way to bring my imagination to life. The video games in my life made me want to switch to learning how to code games when I turned 16 years old. The creations that people made during my time as a child helped me choose what I wanted to do with my life and inspired me to be like the people who were behind some of my favorite things.<br> 	I love the technology we have in our world today, and I plan to learn even more about it. I look forward to learning how to code for websites and video games in the future. I would love to learn more about animation in the future, so that I can do things I’ve always wanted to do ever since I was a kid. I want to learn more about how computers work and how to build them piece by piece. I want to be one of the people that can turn the human imagination into reality, with technology in my future.</p>
